# Awesome Repository Template
Full featured repository template in two steps. 
1. Just edit *DELETEME.txt* and replace the property values to match your needs.
2. Run *DELETEME.py*, `python DELETEME.py` to change the template files according to your property values in step 1.

## How to use this repo template

1. Easy, just fork this repository.
2. Create a new repository and set the template to the forked repo.

3. Clone this new repository locally, it will now contain all the template files.
4. From within the cloned repository, edit **DELETEME.txt** and replace the properties to match your details.
5. Run **DELETEME.py**, it is important that you `cd` to the root of your repository's location then run `python3 DELETEME.py`
6. Execute `git status` to view the changed files. Review these changes and if you are:
   - :smile: - execute `git add . && git commit -m "updating readme with steps" && git push` (or however you commit changes)
   - :sob: - execute `git checkout -- .` to revert everything and try again.

Note, the *.gitignore* will exclude the DELETEME files when committing changes but I suggest you delete them after you are done,  they are useless once you commit these changes.
